# Number Guessing Game

A simple **Java-based Number Guessing Game** created as part of my **virtual internship task**.  
The player has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within a limited number of attempts. 

## Features

- Random number generation within a given range (1–100)
- Feedback on whether the guess is **too high**, **too low**, or **correct**
- **Limited attempts** to increase the challenge
- Option to **play multiple rounds**
- **Score calculation** based on attempts and rounds won
